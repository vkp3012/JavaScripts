// Copy an Array with the Spread Operator
// While slice() allows us to be selective about what elements of an array to copy, among several other useful tasks,
//  ES6's new spread operator allows us to easily copy all of an array's elements, in order, with a simple and highly readable syntax. 
//  The spread syntax simply looks like this: ...

// In practice, we can use the spread operator to copy an array like so:

let thisArray = [true, true, undefined, false, null];
let thatArray = [...thisArray];

// thatArray equals [true, true, undefined, false, null]. thisArray remains unchanged and thatArray contains the same elements as thisArray.

// We have defined a function, copyMachine which takes arr (an array) and num (a number) as arguments. 
// The function is supposed to return a new array made up of num copies of arr. We have done most of the work for you, 
// but it doesn't work quite right yet. Modify the function using spread syntax so that it works correctly 
// (hint: another method we have already covered might come in handy here!).


function copyMachine(arr, num) {
    let newArr = [];
    while (num >= 1) {
      // Only change code below this line
      newArr.push([...arr])
      // Only change code above this line
      num--;
    }
    return newArr;
  }
  
  console.log(copyMachine([true, false, true], 2));


//   Combine Arrays with the Spread Operator
// Another huge advantage of the spread operator is the ability to combine arrays, or to insert all the elements of one array into 
// another, at any index. With more traditional syntaxes, we can concatenate arrays, but this only allows us to combine arrays at 
// the end of one, and at the start of another. Spread syntax makes the following operation extremely simple:

let thisArray1 = ['sage', 'rosemary', 'parsley', 'thyme'];

let thatArray2 = ['basil', 'cilantro', ...thisArray, 'coriander'];

// thatArray would have the value ['basil', 'cilantro', 'sage', 'rosemary', 'parsley', 'thyme', 'coriander'].

// Using spread syntax, we have just achieved an operation that would have been more complex and more verbose had we used traditional 
// methods.

// We have defined a function spreadOut that returns the variable sentence. Modify the function using the spread operator so 
// that it returns the array ['learning', 'to', 'code', 'is', 'fun'].

function spreadOut() {
    let fragment = ['to', 'code'];
    let sentence = ['learning',...fragment,'is','fun']; // Change this line
    return sentence;
  }
  
  console.log(spreadOut());
